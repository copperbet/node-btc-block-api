This is an open-source REST API to explore Bitcoin blockchain data using a **pruned node**.

---

### ⚠️ Limitations

- The backend uses a **pruned Bitcoin node**, so only **recent block data** is available.
- Older blocks or full transaction history may not be retrievable.

---

### 📘 Field Naming Conventions

- All **JSON responses** use `snake_case`
- All \*\*request parameters, query strings, and request bodies\*\* use `camelCase`

---

✅ Ideal for light clients, dashboards, and blockchain status monitors.
